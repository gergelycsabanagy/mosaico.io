In order to make emails and email templates **compatible with most of the clients and webmails** out there, we know that we have to avoid at most everything that is not pure **inline css1 style**.

To be honest this is true mainly for the two bad guys of email rendering - **Outlook and Gmail** - but a lot of other webmails and clients have some glitches and behaviour that makes inline style the good choice.

Coding direct inline styles is really **an hell of work**, and every little adjustment *means tons of code, with lot of errors and mistyping*.

So here come **Email CSS inliners**: these lovely pieces of code take your css and html and give you back your **"css inlined"** email template, ready to be sent.

Simple (ahem...) and effective (ahem...), but *how inliners do work and how much are they reliable*?

How do I choose my inliner? Many ESP have their **native inliners**, and some other are available on web or as library.

We tried to analize the most used of them, in order to understand **the strategy behind, the weakness and the strenghts**.

The CSS inliners we've tested are:

- [Litmus Putsmail](https://putsmail.com/inliner) 
- [Campaign Monitor](https://inliner.cm/)
- [Mailchimp](http://templates.mailchimp.com/resources/inline-css/)
- [Premailer](http://premailer.dialect.ca/)
- [Zurb](http://foundation.zurb.com/emails/inliner.html)
- [Torchbox](https://inlinestyler.torchbox.com/)
- [MailerMailer](http://www.mailermailer.com/labs/tools/magic-css-inliner-tool.rwp)
- [Juice v2.0](http://automattic.github.io/juice/)
- [Styliner v1.0](https://github.com/SLaks/Styliner)

*Inlining is not a plain and simple procedure*: complex css with lot of selectors and rules are not simple to inline, and **sometimes are impossible to**, so every inliner has its strategy to stick css and html dom together.
Moreover css shorthand and tricks makes the things even more chaotic and unpredictable.

Here is a **compact table of the results of test**, the table is quite large, so if you prefer, here is the [google sheets version](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1B4wR8g5JrmD6lNdoQEtw9Z2DzGkrjxRV536ag21nunE/edit?usp=sharing)

We've checked some behaviours we think are important in email design, such has: **multiple property declarations, selectors order, shorthands expansion, @media inclusion strategy, value parsing, pseudoselector support...**

In email design it's usual to use some **property redundance** in order to achieve complete browser/client support. For example, take this code

```css
  .myhumbleclass {
  background-color: #5f9c8c; /* Fallback */
  background-color: rgba(95, 156, 140, 0.7);
  }
```

So, if your browser/client understands rgba colors, it will use them, otherways it will use **the standard hexadecimal rgb color**.
However *most inliners will break this trick*: in case o multiple property values, they will take **only the last value*+, leaving an invalid rule for clients and browser that does not understand rgba colors.

In our test only **Litmus inliner will take every single rule**, even if duplicated, and put it in every piece of Dom indicated by selectors. 
In this case the resulting code will be **huge and extremely verbose, but effective**.

**Styliner** uses a kind of smart behaviour: *it will maintain the duplicated properties only if in the same selector*.
The assumption is that tricks like these are made **within the single selector**, not in multiple selectors. 
The resulting code is somehow less verbose, and in most case the tricks will work.

**Media queries and MEDIA="xyz"** style tag property are not replicable in inlined css, so, ideally, css inliners have to ignore them and leave them in the original format. 
In out tests turns out that **this assumption is no always valid**: only **Litmus** inliner follow this rule, while the other, in best case scenarios keeps correctly **@media, while inlining MEDIA="SCREEN"** style rules and properties (*not so bad, but we think that every style with media indication has to be left untouched, potentially inlining of media screen could break for example the MEDIA="PRINT" rules*), but in worst case we have inliners such as **Premailer an Zurb** that inlines almost every @media and MEDIA content, breaking the whole result.

Moreover the inliner has to decide what to do with the selectors and rules **it does not understand or process**: some decide to **include the whole original style**, like **Campaign Monitor, Mailchimp and MailerMailer**, some other tries to do some optimization, **including only @media and unprocessed selectors** (like **Litmus**), someother **breaks everything** trying to do this (**Styliner**), and, well, **Torchbox strips everything (sigh)**.

Also the way of **handling shorthand could bring some problem**: in css properties order and shorthand use are important, and  **shorthand splitting or aggregation and casual property reorder** in Zurb, Premailer, Torchbox and Styliner could break your template in many subtle ways.

There are also some minor issues, *like if inlining or not !important and html refactoring, indentation and newline insertion*, but the amazing thing is the **number of bugs and potential issues of many inliners**: **MailerMailer**, just to make an example, **cannot process correcty css with quotes** (like url('myurl')) or base64, breaking up the whole template.
Other issues are more subtle, like **casual reorders**, or bad assumption in **property splitting, or value parsing**, that could break special trick and more.

So, inliner is the **the last step in your email design process**: choose it wisely, by now we reccomend, without any doubt, [Litmus Putsmail](https://putsmail.com/inliner), whe think that it has the **right approach**, granting good **preservation of styling** at the price of some verbosity of the final code.

**UPDATE 10 Sep 2016**: Automattic just [released Juice 3.0](https://github.com/Automattic/juice/releases/tag/v3.0.0) with many contributions from @bago (Mosaico developer) and this fixes a lot of Juice issues explored in this article and bring it at the same level of Litmus inliner.
