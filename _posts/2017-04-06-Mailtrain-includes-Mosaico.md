**[Mailtrain](https://mailtrain.org)** defines itself as *"Self Hosted Newsletter App Built on Top of Nodemailer"*: it's an open source project, born in 2016, meant to be an alternative to **commercial ESP** for whom who prefer a **self hosted service**, with complete control on the software beneath.

Mailtrain has grown a lot in the past year, and has a fairly huge fanbase (**over 1.300 stars on GitHub**): its ambitious roadmap includes not only the basic newsletter send features (*list management, custom fields, list segmentation, bounce analysis*...) but also a number of advanced tools, like **RSS campaigns, GPG Encryption, Automation**.

As soon as the project launched we suggested to **[Andris Reinman](https://github.com/andris9)**, the creator of **Mailtrain**, that Mosaico was a *perfect match* for MailTrain and Andris put Mosaico as *possible integration* in official Mailtrain roadmap published on **8 April 2016**.

An year later **[Roger Witzig](https://github.com/witzig)** contributed [the code](https://github.com/Mailtrain-org/mailtrain/pull/167) to let Mailtrain support external email editing tools and added support for both **Mosaico editor** and the wonderful [GrapesJS](http://grapesjs.com/demo-newsletter-editor.html)(\*) editor inside Mailtrain.

A few days ago we received the Mailtrain Announcement newsletter and, guess what? it was **beautiful**, fully **responsive**, sent by Mailtrain itself and.... **designed with Mosaico**.

**Mailtrain** is a young project, but is growing fast so we are happy and proud to be part of this project: test it and let us know what's your opinion.

*(\*) before you get too excited for GrapesJS as an email editor we suggest to read a [couple](https://github.com/Mailtrain-org/mailtrain/issues/10#issuecomment-270751979) of [comments](https://github.com/Mailtrain-org/mailtrain/issues/10#issuecomment-270931061) on why GrapesJS is a great tool but not yet ready for the real world email templates requiring dozens of html hacks*
