**[Mailtrain](https://mailtrain.org)** defines itself as *"Self Hosted Newsletter App Built on Top of Nodemailer"*: it's an open source project, born in 2016, meant to be the solution for who **won't use a commercial ESP**, and prefers a **self hosted service**, with complete control on the software beneath.

Mailtrain has grown a lot in this year, and has a fairly huge fanbase (**over 1.300 stars on GitHub**): it's ambitious roadmap includes not only the basic newsletter send features (*list management, custom fields, list segmentation, bounce analysis*...) but also a number of advanced characteristic, like **RSS campaigns, GPG Encryption, Automation**.

Among the other wonderful features, **[Andris Reinman](https://github.com/andris9)**, the creator of **Mailtrain**, had first put Mosaico as *possible integration* in official Mailtrain roadmap published on **8 April 2016**. 

An year after finally Andris has announced the **total integration of Mosaico editor** inside Mailtrain (and he made this announcement with a beautiful newsletter... **designed with Mosaico** and sent by Mailtrain!).

**Mailtrain** is young, but is growing fast - just like **Mosaico** - so we are happy and proud to be part of this project: test it and let us know what's your opinion.
