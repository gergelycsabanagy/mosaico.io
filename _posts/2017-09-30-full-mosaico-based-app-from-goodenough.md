**[GoodEnough](https://www.goodenough.agency/)** published a full web application built around Mosaico to let companies easily install a complete environment where multiple users can work on email templates using Mosaico. The [project repository](https://github.com/goodenough/mosaico-backend) started as a Mosaico fork, but in fact we see as an application that depends on Mosaico. We are working with GoodEnough so to let their customization being developed as plugins instead of altering the main code, so it will be easier to keep up with new Mosaico releases.

They also published a [Deploy to Heroku button](https://elements.heroku.com/buttons/goodenough/mosaico-backend) to deploy the app to Heroku in minutes. You need an Heroku account, an Amazon AWS account and some Amazon S3 manual configurations to start it, but you will be ready to start your deployment in the cloud very easily.

Here you can see their [screencast](https://youtu.be/sLzZq3cXDi0) about the App.

We are very happy to see the community is embracing our library and developing tools around it, so, if you want your own "standalone" Mosaico editing experience and environment, give a look to the GoodEnough tool!
