### A full web application

**[GoodEnough](https://www.goodenough.agency/)**, a small web agency from Paris, just published a **full web application built around Mosaico** to let companies easily install a **complete environment where multiple users can work on email templates using Mosaico**. 

The [project repository](https://github.com/goodenough/mosaico-backend) **started as a Mosaico fork**, but in fact **we now see it as an application that depends on Mosaico**. We are working with GoodEnough so to let their customization being developed as plugins instead of altering the main code, so it will be easier to keep up with new Mosaico releases.

The App has a very good looking **material design** and is very easy to use and you can easily **appreciate their UX skills**!

### Deploy to Heroku+AWS in minutes

**[Yannick](https://github.com/Hiswe)** and **[Antoine](https://github.com/abernier)**  also published a **[Deploy to Heroku button](https://elements.heroku.com/buttons/goodenough/mosaico-backend)** to deploy the app to Heroku in minutes. You need an Heroku account, an Amazon AWS account and some Amazon S3 manual configurations to start it, but you will be ready to start your own deployment in the cloud in few steps.

Here **you can see their [screencast](https://youtu.be/sLzZq3cXDi0)** about the App.

### Use it!

We are very happy to see the community is embracing our library and developing tools around it, so, if you want your own "standalone" Mosaico editing experience and environment, give a look to the GoodEnough tool!
